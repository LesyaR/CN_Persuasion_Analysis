## Persuasion Technique Definitions***

Below is the list of 23 persuasion techniques explored along with their formal definitions:

- **Doubt** – Undermining credibility by questioning an individual’s character or attributes rather than addressing the actual issue or evidence.
- **Repetition** – Reinforcing a point by reiterating the same idea multiple times within the discourse.
- **Appeal to Fear–Prejudice** – Persuading or rejecting an idea by exploiting fear, aversion, or pre-existing biases toward the idea or its alternatives.
- **Appeal to Authority** – Supporting a claim solely on the basis that it comes from a recognised authority, without presenting independent justification.
- **Slogans** – Using short, memorable phrases that often rely on stereotyping or emotional triggers to influence opinion.
- **Loaded Language** – Employing emotionally charged words or expressions to sway opinion rather than relying on factual reasoning.
- **False Dilemma / No Choice** – Presenting a situation as if there are only two possible options when, in reality, more alternatives exist.
- **Flag-Waving** – Promoting an idea by appealing to group pride or emphasising benefits to a specific community or identity.
- **Name-Calling (Labeling)** – Assigning derogatory or simplistic labels to individuals or groups to discredit them.
- **Causal Oversimplification** – Attributing an outcome to a single cause when multiple contributing factors exist.
- **Consequential Oversimplification (Slippery Slope)** – Ignoring and/or understating the likelihood of the sequence of events from the first event leading to the end point (last event) of the slope.
- **Appeal to Hypocrisy** – Dismissing an argument by accusing its proponent of hypocrisy rather than engaging with the substance of the claim.
- **Obfuscation / Vagueness / Confusion** – Using ambiguous or unclear language that allows multiple interpretations, obscuring the main argument.
- **Exaggeration / Minimisation** – Overstating or downplaying the significance of an event, fact, or claim to distort perception.
- **Red Herring** – Distracting from the main topic by introducing unrelated or tangential issues.
- **Guilt by Association** – Discrediting a person or idea by linking it to a group or concept with negative connotations.
- **Conversation Killer** – Using statements that shut down discussion or discourage further critical engagement.
- **Appeal to Popularity** – Claiming an idea is valid because it is widely accepted or unchallenged.
- **Straw Man** – Misrepresenting an opposing argument in a weakened or distorted form in order to refute it more easily.
- **Questioning the Reputation** – Attacking the moral character or trustworthiness of a person to undermine their position.
- **Appeal to Time** – Arguing that an action is necessary because the “right time” has arrived, without deeper justification.
- **Whataboutism** – Responding to criticism by making a counter-accusation of hypocrisy, avoiding direct engagement with the original argument.
- **Appeal to Values** – Framing an idea as desirable by associating it with values the audience perceives as inherently positive.



## Reproducing the Analysis

1. **Download the datasets**  
   Download the following datasets:
   - CN  
   - DBKF  
   - EUvsDisinfo
  
   To extract the data for DBKF debunks, run the dbkf_query.rq in the following SPARQL end-point: https://dbkf.ontotext.com/graphdb/sparql
   You can then export the results in the preferred format.

3. **Infer the persuasion techniques**

   a. **Set up the GATE Cloud Persuasion API**  
   - Go to the [GATE Cloud Persuasion API](https://gate.ac.uk/cloud) website.  
   - Create an account, log in, and generate your API keys.  
   - Save your API keys in a file named `.env` in the root directory of this repository.  
     The `.env` file should contain the following variable:  
     ```env
     GATE_API_KEY="<YOUR_KEY>"
     ```

   b. **Run the inference script**  
   Call the Persuasion API using the following command:
   ```bash
   python3 infer_api.py
